# Introduction to Business Financial Calculator

- This is a calculator for loan payments on any type of financing options a business would seek. 
- (Coming Soon) It also will run a discounted cash flow valuation on your business, based off of my Clemson University and Duke University, Venture Capital graduate courses. 
- (Coming Soon) We also have a simple calculator for our bio-gestor unit, showing how many hours it would take to completely eliminate animals from a protein farm. And how many labor hours are required.
